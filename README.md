# Smart Task Scheduler
## Author: Tamanna Thakral

A priority-based task scheduler that efficiently manages dynamic task assignments using heaps. It ensures fair workload distribution, minimizes scheduling delays, and optimizes processing times.

## Features ðŸš€
- **Efficient Scheduling:** Uses a min/max heap for **O(log n)** insertion and extraction.
- **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:** Adjusts priorities based on processing times in **O(n log n)** complexity.
- **Fair Workload Distribution:** Ensures balanced task allocation across available resources.
- **Optimized Performance:** Reduces scheduling delays and enhances task execution efficiency.

## Installation & Usage ðŸ“Œ
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Future Improvements âœ¨
- Implement multi-threaded task execution.
- Add a web-based visualization dashboard.
- Introduce ML-based priority adjustments.
